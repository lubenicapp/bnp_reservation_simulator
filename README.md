#### Reservation simulator

To have a seat in the company restaurant, you have to use an app
and select when you want to eat.

Then you have to show a guy that you have a reservation for the hour you want
to eat at the restaurant

this is annoying cause sometimes your forget to make a reservation in time, or you miss the appointment
or you want to go eat with a colleague earlier/later instead ...

Well since we only have to show a summary of the reservation (no QR code involved)
Here is a tool that reproduce the visual.

you can access it here : https://unicity-resa.herokuapp.com/
it is designed for mobile view


code is made public for an intern who was curious otherwise I would not display it
